# gh-vibe

A github extension that contains a collection of my commonly used gh commands when I'm vibe coding

This is still a work in progress but eventually it will contain:
* A command that protects the main branch and sets my default repository settings
* A command that creates an gh issue for setting up AI instructions and automatically assigns to copilot
* A command that marks the a PR ready for review and merges it
